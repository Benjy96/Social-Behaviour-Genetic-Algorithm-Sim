# Social-Behaviour-Genetic-Algorithm-Sim
Trying to see whether anti-social or social behaviour emerges in agents with friendly and violent capabilities in a survival game mode.

Fitness will be determined by a food level/whether they survived other NPCs. The hungriest (or dead) NPCs will be rated unfit, and will not breed the next generation.

Resource gathering (food) will rid the generations of "lazy" NPCs that sit and spin on the spot or walk into walls, producing movement & obstacle avoidance.

The interesting part will be emergent behaviour between NPCs when I add in a full range of interactions, determined by their genes.

Emergent behaviour comes from an agent, following rules, being able to interpret and affect its environment. For example, the agents have a colour linked to their aggressiveness. Other agents, upon seeing this, will take different actions. This should produce behaviours such as fleeing, attacking, or perhaps grouping up with other agents that aren't aggressive.
